Want to be able to filter by category:
	Crime type
		category decreasing severity by number
	Time of day
	Date onward
	Generally clean up the data columns

Move from descriptive to predictive
	Approximate p(crime | x)
		start: x = location
		right now we have p(x,y)
		want p(y | x) 
		later: x = location, time of day, information from other data sets (dst_to_school

Start adding new data

Homework:
	Kathryn:		Get walking directions from JHSPH to the metro using the google api
	Joshua:			Given an edge, come up with an algorithm to map crime data to the edge
	Christiana:	Figure out how to filter by category
