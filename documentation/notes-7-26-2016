Big Picture:
	Devices
		Webserver
		Phone
	Workflow:
		Phone sends coords to webserver
		Webserver computes weighted shortest path
		Webserver sends series of waypoints back to phone
		Phone looks up on google
	
Webserver Functions:
	getDirections(start,end)
	shortestPath(start,end,matrix)
	getDistanceMatrix()
	reweightDistanceMatrix(matrix)
	passToPhone()
	getFromPhone()
	beServer()
Phone:
	passToWebserver()
	displayToUser()
	getFromWebserver()

Homework:
	KK: put in skeleton for path computation,API documentation
	EF: Clean up all the existing code, get function to do shortest path, get points for distance matrix
	CC: Work on passing waypoints to the navigation app pass the path key to the navigation app
	CS: Think about better ways to estimate probability
